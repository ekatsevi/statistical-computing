## Debugging tips

- If the repository state becomes too messed up, then you can follow these steps:
  1. Move the files you have changed since the previous commit to a temporary directory.
  2. Delete the directory on your computer containing the messed up repository via `rm -rf <directory-name>`.
  3. Clone the repository again from GitHub.
  4. Copy the files you have changed since the previous commit from the temporary directory to the new repository directory.
