## Generate an SSH key {#sec-ssh-keygen}

Check whether you already have an SSH key by typing `ls ~/.ssh` at the command line and seeing whether are files named `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`. If not, generate an SSH key by typing

``` bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" 
```

at the command line. Press enter when prompted with Enter file in which to save the key to choose the default, and then type a passphrase when prompted with `Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase)`. Alternately, do not type a passphrase by simply pressing enter twice.

If you are on MacOS, create a file called `config` in the directory `~/.ssh` with the contents

``` bash
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

The purpose of this step is to have the MacOS keychain store your SSH key passphrase.
