# HPC setup {.appendix}

## Set up password-less access to HPC {#sec-passwordless-hpc-access}

First, [generate an SSH key on your local machine](local-setup.qmd#sec-ssh-keygen). Then, copy your SSH public key from your local machine to the HPC by typing

``` bash
ssh-copy-id <username>@<hpc-address>
```

at the Terminal of your local machine and then enter your login credentials. At this point, you should be able to SSH into your HPC without entering your password; try it out by typing

``` bash
ssh <username>@<hpc-address>
```
